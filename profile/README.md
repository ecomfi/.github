# Finago Ecom

We develop financial management software for the HVAC and construction sectors in Finland.

Our solutions include a "Classic" Windows application suite written mostly in Pascal, and a modern web solution Ecom with a NodeJS/React stack running on Google cloud infrastructure.

We are recruiting full-stack developers living in Finland. No Finnish skills required.  
If you are interested in joining our team, contact our team manager sami.perasaari@ecom.fi
